									<span class="date">About The Company</span>
									
									<p>Founded in 1965, CI investment is one of Canada’s largest investment fund companies. In the early days, The company became known for its expertise in foreign funds and adopted the name Canadian International Fund Management. Over the years, CI expanded its lineup of funds to provide investors with an increasingly comprehensive offering of Canadian.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>On the IT side, CI is a mature company with a well-built workflow and methods to help support the company’s system. Currently, they are still using some methodologies from the waterfall model and combine with modern models like Agile at the same time (depending on the area of application).
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <span class="date">About My Manager</span>
									
									<p>I am working as part of the change management team under the leadership of Andrew Szpir. Andrew has joined CI before I was born and is a senior manager at IT’s production control. He is super experienced in change management and release management process with great leadership in a robust team. Under the mentorship of him, I have developed important skillsets such as multitasking, problem-solving, communication and so much more to help me expand my horizon.
                                    </p>

                                                                    
                                    <span class="date">Job Description</span>
									
                                    <p>Working as a change management coordinator, my main responsibilities included approving Software Change Requests (SCR), Refresh Change Requests (RCR), Infrastructure Change Requests (ICR), and other change requests in Jira Confluence. During a change request, I had to coordinate, verify data information then implement code changes for in-house application to test. There are a lot of types of change requests that have different implementation purposes, therefore it was important to understand the content and purpose of the requests before doing anything.  </p>
                                    <p>Unlike other developer/tester jobs, change management is a completely different field. It requires a university degree related to IT field with previous working experience and the role barely has any programming tasks. My role during the 4 months is a task-based rather than a project-based job, in specific, I was help dealing with change requests on a daily basis. </p>
                                    <p>It was important to thoroughly understand the Change Management/Release Management process and concepts before getting started with implementations and approvals. The team gave me a lot of training and help to familiarize myself with the process. At the end of the Co-op term, I was confident enough to work independently and help new employees by presenting the processes and walkthroughs with PowerPoint. </p>

                                    <span class="date">Goals</span>
                                    
                                    <p> My primary goal was to be familiar with procedures and rules pertaining to Change Management activities. This could help me understand the workflow faster and start working on requests without too much hesitation. With coaching from Andrew and teammate Mark and Ethan, I was able to understand the general process in a timely manner. </p>
                                    <p> After fully understand and familiarize the workflow, I got to work on some of the change requests. Change requests needed to be implemented/approved by different tools such as Jira Confluence, IBM rational, and system matrix. My next goal was to master the software tools that were required with the requests. My team demonstrated to me how to use them pertaining to change requests which were beneficial to me and answered any questions that I had on my mind.  </p>
                                    <p> I was able to achieve most of my goals with the guide from my manager and team. By the end of the 4 month Co-op term, I was able to understand and deal with most of the common change requests. There were some rare change requests that I did not get enough opportunities to practice with, still made me struggling a bit, and needed to confirm the process with my team.  </p>
                                    <p> Overall, the goals I set for myself to complete for this work term has helped me developed problem solving, communication, and understanding skills that will be beneficial in my upcoming Co-op work terms in a similar team environment. </p>
                                
                                    <span class="date">Conclusion</span>
									
									<p>My experience at CI investment has been very valuable in furthering my career goals, technical skills, and knowledge as well as my interpersonal skills. Not only the skills I developed during the time, but it also really helped me to get a better understanding of my future career path. I really appreciate this opportunity to work with the change management team, CI company, and get to known many mentors helped me direct my career path.</p>
                                    <p>It was very unfortunate that my co-op term happened during COVID, where I was working remotely at my house and never get the chance to go to the office or meet with the team. I would love to meet with the team members in person if I ever get the chance to!</p>
