									<span class="date">About The Company</span>
									<p>Roadmunk is a young software company that designs/customize roadmapping tools as their main product. A roadmap is essentially a visual representation of a strategic planning tool that answers questions like: what is the goal, who will be involved to achieve the goal, and what are the milestones of it. 
									</p>
									
									<p>Currently roadmunk has 2 offices with one in Kitchener and one in Toronto. Kitchener office is the ‘tech’ office, where most of the developers work there. However due to the Covid-19 situation, most of the employees work from home, including myself.
									</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <span class="date">About My Manager</span>
									
									<p>I am reporting to Derek Veenstra, my team manager during my coop term. Working as a dev manager, he is very responsible, fast communication and with a sense of humor.</p>

                                                                    
                                    <span class="date">Job Description</span>								

                                    <p>I participated in a part of a small-agile development team to deliver quality solutions for our customers.
									</p>

									<p>Working as a software test specialist, I mainly used exploratory strategy to perform session based testing on new web application features and bug fixes, to ensure the quality of our product is up to standard. I have never learn testing at school, this was a brand new start for me. In this term I used some modern tools & softwares such as AWS and Salesforce, which I was excited to learn as they are popular through-out software companies.
									</p>

									<p>Everytime I take a Jira card, the first thing I need to do is to understand what information the card is presenting. It can help me with conducting my tests, rather than just searching in the dark. I also keep communicating with the responsible developer for more information. When testing, I document my testing procedure as I test. I start with testing basic functionalities, then proceed to test the change’s impact on other functionalities, and trying to find any edge cases that can affect the feature negatively. After testing documentation is completed, it will be debriefed and the change will deploy to production.
									</p>

									<p>I also did performance testing on server loading/response times to help improve the overall usability of Roadmunk’s product. Time data were collected and shared with corresponding developers. When collecting data, I made a python script to automatically sum up values from logs to reduce the testing speed and improve overall performance quality.
									</p>

                                    <span class="date">Goals</span>
                                   
                                    <p>I need to have a good understanding on how test specialists conduct test cases at the company and what’s my responsibility in the development workflow. My initial goal is to conduct test cases in a time efficient, quality-focused way. To level up my abilities, I need to learn from other test specialists, take notes and analyze the most efficient way to perform a test case.
									</p>

									<p>Apart from improving at testing, I also need to improve my written skills in test documentations/reports. It is not difficult to document the testing procedures with technical details and concepts, however it would be hard for non-engineers to read and understand my interpretation. I need to put myself into other people’s shoes and review the docs as non-technical roles to see if I can understand what I wrote, and improve upon it. 
									</p>

									<p>Lastly I want to have some understanding on the automation side of testing. With the short 4 month period I wouldn’t fully master it, but I will do my best to absorb knowledge by pairing up with developers. It will be great to know both manual and code testing, furthermore expanding my horizons in my career.
									</p>

                                    <span class="date">Conclusion</span>
									
									<p>I have experienced some down time with the company, the main reason is employees being laid off from company's financial struggle, and we were looking for a new direction to carry on strong. It was a diverse but precious experience for me to understand the part of not only my role/software company workflow, but also overcoming the difficulty of company cultural changes & employee turnover after the change. The short 4 month helped me prepare what can happen to myself when I set my foot in the real world.</p>

                                    <p>I would like to thank my manager, Derek V, my mentors, TJ Shears/Rebecca/Bailey/Wyatt and so many other amazing people, not only coached me during my term but also gave me life advice for the future work environment. Last but not least, I want to thank Greg Klotz for giving me this opportunity. I appreciate your time for reading this, please feel free to submit any feedback! </p>
                                    <span class="date">End
